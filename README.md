## About Me
I am a costume designer and dressmaker located in the greater DC area. Before I stared working 
in the field of costuming, I was a company ballet dancer with Russian Ballet Orlando for many 
years. I have been sewing for over 12 years, since a very early age. My performing background 
has given me a very comprehensive skill set, as well as an extensive knowledge of what it takes 
to create high-quality costumes. In addition to designing costumes for theater, I also enjoy 
dressmaking.
